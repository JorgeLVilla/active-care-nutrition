We recommend taking one gummy daily, either at or around the time of a meal or snack, to ensure optimal absorption.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Taking the gummies with a meal or snack containing some fat can naturally support the absorption of the essential fat-soluble vitamins in our product. By doing so, your body can utilize the nutrients more efficiently, resulting in maximum benefits.<\/p><p><\/p><p>It's essential to follow the recommended dosage and only exceed it if your healthcare practitioner advises. Taking more than the recommended dosage can result in adverse effects, including potential toxicity.<\/p><p><\/p><p>It's also crucial to keep our Immunity & Energy Gummies out of reach of children. While our product is safe and designed for adults, children's bodies may not be able to handle the vitamins' dosage effectively. Keeping the product away from children will ensure their safety.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Finally, storing our gummies in a cool, dry place without direct sunlight is essential. Storing them in such conditions will prevent any deterioration or spoilage of the product, ensuring their efficacy and quality are maintained.<\/p>",

These proteins accelerate the chemical processes that transform food into compounds that can be absorbed by your digestive system.\n\nThere are digesting enzymes in your saliva. They are also expelled by a few of your organs, such as the gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. Digestive enzymes are also kept in cells that line the outside of your intestines.\n\nHowever, you can also add digestive enzymes into your diet if you need to improve your body's performance, digestion, and recovery. All our ActiveCare products follow a multi-enzyme approach that ensures superior absorption of vital macro and micro nutrients in your body and throughout your daily diet."
