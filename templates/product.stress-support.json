By taking the gummies with some food containing fat, your body can naturally support the absorption of essential fat-soluble vitamins in our product, allowing you to enjoy maximum benefits, however it is not mandatory. <\/p><p><\/p><p>To ensure safety and efficacy, follow the recommended dosage and only exceed it if your healthcare practitioner advises. Remember, taking too much can lead to potential toxicity and adverse effects.<\/p><p><\/p><p>When it comes to the safety of our loved ones, it's vital to keep our Stress Support Gummies out of reach of children. Our product is safe for adults, but children's bodies may not be able to handle the vitamins' dosage effectively, so it's best to be cautious.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Finally, keeping our gummies in a cool, dry place without direct sunlight can help maintain their efficacy and quality. You shouldn't have to worry about stress when you're taking care of yourself; with our Stress Support Gummies, you won't have to.<\/p>",

These proteins accelerate the chemical processes that transform food into compounds that can be absorbed by your digestive system.\n\nThere are digesting enzymes in your saliva. They are also expelled by a few of your organs, such as the gallbladder, liver, and pancreas. Digestive enzymes are also kept in cells that line the outside of your intestines.\n\nHowever, you can also add digestive enzymes into your diet if you need to improve your body's performance, digestion, and recovery. All our ActiveCare products follow a multi-enzyme approach that ensures superior absorption of vital macro and micro nutrients in your body and throughout your daily diet."
