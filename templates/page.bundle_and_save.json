It combines physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual factors in your ability to thrive rather than merely survive. \n\nWhole body wellness is essential to help prevent disease, reduce the risk of chronic and acute injuries, successfully treat existing conditions and become a more productive and happier person."

            "answer": "Great Question!\n\nIn our fast-paced world, factors like stress, traveling, environmental changes, and unhealthy diets can impact our overall well-being and how we age. Embracing whole body health and aligning with our natural circadian rhythms is crucial for a vibrant and balanced life.\n\nImagine your body as a thriving, interconnected ecosystem made up of trillions of enzymes, microorganisms, and fungi. Nourishing this complex network with essential nutrients, beneficial bacteria, digestive enzymes, and natural adaptogens promotes comprehensive health and well-being from within.\n\nBy aligning your body's internal ecosystem with your circadian rhythms, you promote holistic wellness that lays the foundation for a strong, resilient, and balanced life."

            "question": "What Are Probiotic Fiber Gummies?",
            "answer": "Probiotics are specific strains of live bacteria chosen for their immense health benefits to the body. These beneficial microbes can be added to a wide range of foods and taken as dietary supplements.\n\nAlthough they are both essential for the good health of the immune system, probiotics should not be mistaken for a prebiotic fiber blend, which is a non-digestible supplement taken as a source of food for the growth of essential gut microbiome colony-forming units.\n\nOne such food-bacteria combination is the addition of probiotics to gummy bear candies to produce probiotic gummies.\n\nThese adult probiotic gummies are great for guarding the body against a host of ailments associated with digestive and cognitive health."

            "answer": "We recommend you take one gummy either at or around the time of a meal or snack to ensure optimal absorption. By taking the gummies with some food containing fat, your body can naturally support the absorption of essential fat-soluble vitamins in our product, allowing you to enjoy maximum benefits; however, it is not mandatory. \n\nIt's essential to follow the recommended dosage and only exceed it if your healthcare practitioner advises. \n\nTaking more than the recommended dosage can result in adverse effects, including potential toxicity.\n\nIt is important to consult with your healthcare professional prior to use if you are taking any medications, have any medical conditions or are allergic to any of the listed ingredients."
